## üöÄ What Can You Do with This?
This jammer is based on the ESP32 with 30 pins and two NRF24 modules. With its capabilities, you can effectively interfere with Bluetooth, BLE, drones, and Wi-Fi signals.

## What is essential for creation?
To create this project, you will need: 
1. two NRF24L01+PA+LNA modules
2. ESP32 30 pins
3. two 16V capacitors rated at 100¬µF
4. 128x32 display
5. tactile button
